Using NLTK to build naive bayes spam filter

1. Python


2. NLTK

Natural Language Toolkit was developed in conjunction with a Computational Linguistics course at the University of
Pennsylvania in 2001. It is a collection of modules and corpora, released under an open-source license, which allows
students to learn and conduct research in NLP. NLTK can be used not only as a training complex, but also as a ready
analytical tool or basis for the development of applied text processing systems. Nowadays it is widely used in linguistics,
artificial intelligence, machine learning projects, etc. There are a lot of advantages of using NLTK. The most important one is that it is entirely self-contained. Not only does it provide raw and annotated versions of real-world data in the form of 60 corpora, grammar collections, and trained models, it also provides convenient functions that can be used as building blocks for common NLP tasks.
