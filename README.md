Using NLTK to build naive bayes spam filter

1. Python
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, http://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.
2. NLTK
Natural Language Toolkit was developed in conjunction with a Computational Linguistics course at the University of Pennsylvania in 2001. It is a collection of modules and corpora, released under an open-source license, which allows students to learn and conduct research in NLP. NLTK can be used not only as a training complex, but also as a ready analytical tool or basis for the development of applied text processing systems. Nowadays it is widely used in linguistics, artificial intelligence, machine learning projects, etc. There are a lot of advantages of using NLTK. The most important one is that it is entirely self-contained. Not only does it provide raw and annotated versions of real-world data in the form of 60 corpora, grammar collections, and trained models, it also provides convenient functions that can be used as building blocks for common NLP tasks.
