============================

## Background

This project is using Python to build a spam filter with Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network using Enron Email Corpus(ham:16454, spam:17171). (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/). Useful information can be found at http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/docs/ceas2006_paper.pdf .
## Tools

scikit-learn http://scikit-learn.org/stable/

NLTK  http://nltk.org/

BeautifulSoup  http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/

Scipy http://www.scipy.org/

Numpy http://www.numpy.org/



## Project Details

1. Load enron emails corpus into memory

2. Tokenize files into word, and store them into lists

3. Feature extracte 

4. Feature selection based on the words from corpus

5. Training classifiers with Naive Bayes and SVM algorithm

6. Evaluating the classifier 

7. Checking results and imporve accuaracy and running speed

  1). more datasets
  2). reduce demonsionality
  3). add prori probability
  4). optimizate the program
