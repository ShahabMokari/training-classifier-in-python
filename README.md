============================

## Background

This project is using Python to build a spam filter with Naive Bayes Classifier with Enron Email Corpus. (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/).

## Tools

NLTK

Natural Language Toolkit was developed in conjunction with a Computational Linguistics course at the University of Pennsylvania in 2001. It is a collection of modules and corpora, released under an open-source license, which allows students to learn and conduct research in NLP. NLTK can be used not only as a training complex, but also as a ready analytical tool or basis for the development of applied text processing systems. Nowadays it is widely used in linguistics, artificial intelligence, machine learning projects, etc.
